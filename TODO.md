# TODO LIST:
0. Bug Fix!
1. Private Chatrooms:
- You can create your own private chatroom by adding `?room=<room id>` to the end of the url, and it creates a chatroom that only people with the same url can see. This shouldn't be too hard.
2. Toggleable tag buttons, as requested in issue #19
3. Add Active User Sidebar to Extension and Unichat Website
