# TODO LIST:
0. Bug Fix!
1. Private Chatrooms:
- You can create your own private chatroom by adding `?room=<room id>` to the end of the url, and it creates a chatroom that only people with the same url can see. This shouldn't be too hard.
2. Toggleable tag buttons, as requested in issue #19
3. Add active user sidebar to Chrome Extension (assigned to \_iPhoenix\_)
