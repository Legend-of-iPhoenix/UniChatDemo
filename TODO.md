# TODO LIST:
0. Bug Fix!
1. Private Chatrooms:
- You can create your own private chatroom by adding `?room=<room id>` to the end of the url, and it creates a chatroom that only people with the same url can see. This shouldn't be too hard.
2. Toggleable tag buttons, as requested in issue #19
3. Add active user sidebar to Chrome Extension (LAX18 volunteered for this)
4. Remove Scrollbars in Extension and in Webpage (but still allow scrolling)
5. Make Mozilla Firefox Extension - Temporary Chrome Port Is Functional!
6. Make sure extension is working!  Done!
