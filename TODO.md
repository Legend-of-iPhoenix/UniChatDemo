# TODO LIST:
0. Bug Fix!
1. Private Chatrooms:
- You can create your own private chatroom by adding `?room=<room id>` to the end of the url, and it creates a chatroom that only people with the same url can see. This shouldn't be too hard.
2. Toggleable tag buttons, as requested in issue #19
3. Remove Scrollbars in Extension and in Webpage (but still allow scrolling)
4. Make Mozilla Firefox Extension (Might be complete?)
5. Make IRC Bot - Linking from UniChat to IRC (might not be feasable w/o some server space :/)
6. Fix active users bug - caused by internet lag.
