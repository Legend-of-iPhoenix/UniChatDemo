# UniChat

## To start contributing:
Press the fork button. You now have your own copy of UniChat, where you can test things out before committing.
When you are done, create a pull request with your changes.

**IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY UP TO DATE WITH THE OFFICIAL ONE**

## When creating a pull request:
- Make sure your code actually works.
- Describe what it does (and optionally how it does what it does)
- Your code **MUST** do something. No adding comments just to get the badge.
- Be patient. We might want to check your changes to make sure they work as-hyped, and we might even add commits of our own to improve what you have.
- It saves us a lot of time if you set up (free) github pages for your repository, and link it in your pull request.
- We do not accept contributions that are inappropriate or give benefits to a  UniChat user. In the latter scenerio, please create an issue.
- If your contribution is accepted, you will be granted the contributor title on UniChat. Please include your UniChat username in your pull request so I (\_iPhoenix\_/Legend-of-iPhoenix, or LAX18, if he is available) can grant you the title.
