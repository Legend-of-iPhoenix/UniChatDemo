    <h1>UniChat User Agreement</h1>
    <h1>Last Revised January 19, 2018. Effective January 19, 2018</h1>

    <p>We reserve the right to monitor UniChat, and your use of the Service means you agree to such monitoring. At the same time, we do not guarantee we will monitor at all times (or at all).</p>
    <p>III - UniChat is for your personal, lawful use</p>
    <p>UniChat is designed and supported for personal use only. You may not use UniChat to break the law, violate an individual's privacy, or infringe any person or entity&rsquo;s intellectual property or any other proprietary rights.</p>
    <h3>IV - UniChat is for fun and enjoyment</h3>
    <p>UniChat is intended to be a place for your entertainment. We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on something you read on UniChat.</p>
    <p>V - UniChat&rsquo;s Content</p>
    <p>UniChat contains text, code, and a website "look and feel,", which we consider part of our content. We grant you the right to access the UniChat content and in the manner of open source, you may duplicate source code (with original copyright and authors credits displayed)</p>
    <p>VI - Your Content</p>
    <p>You retain the rights to your copyrighted content or information that you submit to</p>
    <p>&nbsp;UniChat ("user content") except as described below.</p>
    <p>By submitting user content to UniChat, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.</p>
    <p>You agree that you have the right to submit anything you post, and that your user content does not violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other personal or proprietary right of any other party.</p>
    <p>VII - We don&rsquo;t endorse User Content</p>
    <p>We take no responsibility for, we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, and we do not assume any liability for any user content submitted by you to UniChat.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;VIII - Links and UniChat</h3>
    <p>UniChat is a place with many third-party hyperlinks posted by users like you. We are not responsible for the content or actions of any third party websites or services associated with posted links. You agree to take sole legal responsibility for any links you post, and this agreement does not apply to any content on other websites related to those links. You should consult the terms and privacy policies of those other websites to understand your rights.</p>
    <h3>IX - UniChat's Rules</h3>
    <h3>I - Your Participation on UniChat</h3>
    <p>You also agree to follow the UniChat Basic Rules available on the <a href="https://legend-of-iphoenix.github.io/UniChatDemo/about/index.html">UniChat About Website</a>. These guidelines are intended to keep people safe, protect people, keep UniChat running, and to encourage personal responsibility for what you do on UniChat.</p>
    <p>II - Private Chat Room Rules</p>
    <p>Private Chat Rooms may create their own rules and enforce them as they see fit, providing they do not violate the terms of this agreement.</p>
    <p>You agree that UniChat is not responsible for the actions taken or not taken by moderators and administrators.</p>
    <p>The rules that apply to the default room and that are described here, apply in ALL chat rooms on UniChat.</p>
    <h3>III - Don't Spam the UniChat Community</h3>
    <p>You may not post any text or other material that we deem to be junk or spam. Cluttering UniChat with this sort of content reduces the quality of the UniChat experience for others.</p>
    <h3>IV - Don't mess with UniChat</h3>
    <p>You agree not to interrupt the serving of UniChat, make it difficult for anyone else to use UniChat due to your actions, or assist anyone in misusing UniChat in any way. It takes a lot of work to maintain UniChat. Be cool.</p>
    <p>Impersonating others is strictly prohibited. If you think someone is impersonating you or another UniChat user, please contact &ldquo;_iPhoenix_&rdquo; or &ldquo;LAX18&rdquo; with relevant timestamps or screenshots through a private message on Cemetech.</p>
    <p>We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a UniChat security issue, please send relevant information about the exploit to &ldquo;_iPhoenix_&rdquo; or &ldquo;LAX18&rdquo; in a private message on Cemetech.</p>
    <h3>X - Inappropriate User Content</h3>
    <p>We retain the right to remove user content on UniChat that we deem to be infringing on the rights of others. If you become aware of user content on UniChat that infringes your rights, you may submit a request to &ldquo;_iPhoenix_&rdquo; or &ldquo;LAX18&rdquo; in a private message on Cemetech.</p>
    <p>If we remove your user content in response to right infringement, we will not be obligated to notify you via any means.</p>
    <p>It is UniChat's policy to block users we identify as repeat infringers. We apply this policy at our discretion and in appropriate circumstances, such as when a user has repeatedly been charged with infringing on the rules of UniChat or the rights of others.</p>
    <p>Bypassing such blocking by creating a new account is in violation of this agreement.</p>
    <h3>XI - Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
    <p>UniChat is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content. We do not guarantee that UniChat will always work properly.</p>
    <h3>XII - Severability and Enforcement</h3>
    <p>If any provision of this user agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent. If no such modification is possible, that provision will be severed from the rest of this agreement.</p>
    <p>If we do not enforce any right or provision in this user agreement, that is not to be deemed a waiver of our right to do so in the future.</p>
    <h2>XIII - Changes to this User Agreement</h2>
    <p>This user agreement is the entire agreement between you and us concerning UniChat. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and us. We may modify this user agreement at any time. If we make changes to this agreement that materially affect your rights, we will attempt provide advance notice. By continuing to use UniChat after a change to this agreement, you agree to those changes.</p>
