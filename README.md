Mostly done by \_iPhoenix\_, with some styling help from MrDKKing.

Some parts of the link detection were made by Christopher Mitchell (KermM) of the Cemetech programming community, and is used in the community's chat script, SAX, from which a lot of inspiration has been taken. 

Small portions of the code were found on Stack Overflow and the MDN, and have been modified to fit my needs. They are amazing sites for programming help.
