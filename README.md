# UniChat

## Credits

Mostly done by \_iPhoenix\_, with some styling help from MrDKKing, and some edits and awesomeness by LAX18.

Favicon and header image made by LAX18.

The UniChat Chrome Extension was made by LAX18!

Some parts of the link detection were made by Christopher Mitchell (KermM) of the Cemetech programming community, and are used in the community's chat script, SAX, from which a lot of inspiration has been taken. 

Small portions of the code were found on Stack Overflow and the MDN, and have been modified to fit my needs. They are amazing sites for programming help.
